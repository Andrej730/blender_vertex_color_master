Blender 2.80 vertex paint differences:

brush.vertex_tool (seems to be for the draw mode, not blend)
DRAW, BLUR, AVERAGE, SMEAR

brush.blend
MIX, DARKEN, MUL, COLORBURN, LINEARBURN, LIGHTEN, SCREEN, COLORDODGE, ADD, OVERLAY, SOFTLIGHT, HARDLIGHT, VIVIDLIGHT, LINEARLIGHT, PINLIGHT, DIFFERENCE, EXCLUSION, SUB, HUE, SATURATION, COLOR, LUMINOSITY, ERASE_ALPHA, ADD_ALPHA

Issues / TODO:
Look into how people may want to use vertex color and try to accomodate the use cases

+ Vertex alpha painting is not working properly
+ Would be nice to be able to toggle face or vertex mask from VCM UI
+ Add gradient tool back
+ Add submitted circular gradient tool
+ changing value does not change brush color in isolate mode
+ see if I can fix rounding errors during UV>color translation
+ make sure that apply isolate channel works properly and has elegant fallbacks when vcol data is renamed

+ material color to vertex color? bake or object material color?
+ view vertex color for multiple objects
+ vertex paint multiple objects (might require c++ coding and patch submission, might also be really hard?)
+ bake ambient occlusion shortcut
+ randomise island color to single channel
+ gradient shading based on distance from selection (kinda like soft selection?)
+ bake vertex color to texture (single channel or RGBA)

Add quick menu/pie with shortcut for activation
- brush settings: color/value, brush size, rate, etc.
- channel settings: isolate channel / exit isolate
- masking + selection
- quick operations: fill, invert

Add Vertex color workspace (is it possible to add a workspace from menu when addon is active?)
